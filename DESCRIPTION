Description: Impute missing values in a data matrix using weighted-kNN. Weights
     in w-kNN are specified using a Gaussian kernel, specified by kernlab. Imputation may be done via parallel computing (v0.4). Canopies (ie-subsets) were implemented in (v0.6) and provide approximate solutions for large datasets... I suggest not
     using canopies on datasets with < ~10^5 observations and using canopies on
     datasets with > ~10^5 observations.
